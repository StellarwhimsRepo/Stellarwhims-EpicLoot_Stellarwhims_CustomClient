# Epic Loot custom changes

This mod contains json config files for [EpicLoot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/)
mod, so, mostly enchanting materials will get dropped. If you are using a mod that allows higher star level monsters, generally,
three star and up will start dropping gear. Monster specific loot (example: troll armor) has been changed to drop only from those 
specific monsters and their loot starts appearing at two stars. In addition, I will be updating as many of the .json files in epicloot 
as neccessary to bring a sense of balance as far as we (the players on my private server) percieve it.

Mostly damage nerfs.

Some Parry, Block, Stamina and Health Regen effects are nerfed, and set to legendary only.

Parry, Block, Stamina and Health Regen for lowhealth are still available to roll as normal.

Removed bows from attack speed effect.

Recipes to build trophies have been removed.

Mythic crafting knowledge has been lost to the ages ...

Keep an eye on the patch notes as this description is more of a general guideline.

# Eitr and other items integration

Be aware:
This mod changes epic loot to drop Greydwarf Eye, Root, Freeze Gland, Dragon Tear, Fuling Totem, Eitr and recipes to use those ingredients, instead of rarity appropriate dust.

## Installation

* Automated: just install as long as using TMM or R2Modman.
* Manual: you need to know what you are doing ;)

Since this mod now uses json config files, no files from the original EpicLoot are overwritten.

If you are using other Epic Loot json config mods, you will need to consult the Epic Loot discord for help integrating them.

The json priority set on the files is left at a default of 500.
